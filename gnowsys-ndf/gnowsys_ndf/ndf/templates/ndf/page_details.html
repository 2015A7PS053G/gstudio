<p>
    Pages are user-written articles on a range of subjects. Any contributor or a group of contributors can create (and own) new articles, and there can be multiple articles on the same topic, each written by a different author.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Who can make a page?</h5>
  <p>
    Anyone with an account can create a new article. When creating a new article, the initial contributor can choose to have a defined list of authors, all of whom can edit the page, or have an open, wiki-like format where anyone can contribute.
