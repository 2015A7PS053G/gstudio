	3.2 A final confirmation prompt which displays total number of nodes.
4. After completion of dump, the path of data-dump and log file will be displayed.

How to take RESTORE?

1. Go to manage.py level
2. python manage.py group_import
	3.1. This will prompt absolute path of data-dump [ref. DUMP pt.4]:
			Enter Path
	3.2. Next prompt will be whether you want to use User objects that are part of dump.
		[if DUMP 3.1 is yes]
		If you do not wish to use the users from the dump, say 'no', and the program will 
		give another prompt that, the default user-id [as creator or contributor] used wille be 1
		.Enter yes to proceed or say no to provide a default user-id in the next prompt.
3. Run fab update_data
4. After completion of dump, the path of log file will be displayed.


Note:
Remember, the import script generates bunch of json files at manage.py level
Run `rm 5*` to get rid of them

If the dump or restore breaks at any point or if the restore does not reflect properly,
make sure you have the log files generated at dump and restore actions, and send them on 
gnowsys-dev@gnowledge.org.
